                    <div class="article-text"><p> I remembered the other day reading a poem by a friend of mine. She often wrote whatever occured
                        to her mind. She was calling it poetry although it didn't rhyme nor had any rythm or musicality whatsoever. It was plain text. The thing is that it made absolutely
                        no sense at all. Well I am not exactly an expert in poetry although I do write my own poems from time to time whenever I feel like something is worth writing about.
                        I definitely am chasing after a more direct approach. I want the poem to have a sense of musicality as you read through it and also be direct in regards to its meaning.
                        As I was talking with that friend of mine, I asked her, well what does she mean, what is she trying to say with her poem. She said the meaning is what you make of what you
                        are reading. Well if you put 10 random words in random order in front of me, I will think something out of it, we are pattern-observing creatures after all. I do believe
                        that art just as anything else should have a practical purpose. I don't want to make my own meaning. When I read something I want to read about someone else's story, emotions
                        and struggles. Of course I can see myself in some aspects of the story.</p>
                        <br><p>>In conclusion what I am trying to say is that I don't believe that what she really wanted was to write something that is that much abstract. I think that maybe she wants
                            to write because she is into literature due to her studies. She wants to be socially accepted and revered, but misses what makes a good artist, practice, passion, struggles,
                            experiences, and of course creating art for something and not for art itself.</p>
                            <br><p>But that is just my opinion and it doesn't matter what I believe or feel. Everyone should choose for themselves what they enjoy or not, but accept what they really enjoy
                                rather than what their social group considers as accepted or cool.

                    <h4><!-- enter author name here -->Author: Chris Athanasiadis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- enter date here -->6/7/2023</h4></p></div>
                    
                    <div class="article-text"><p>While modern gaming has undoubtedly brought exciting advancements, it's essential to reflect on the aspects that made old school gaming so beloved.
                         One downside of modern gaming is the shift towards a more streamlined and casual experience. In the past, games often required perseverance, patience, and skill to progress.
                          Nowadays, hand-holding tutorials, frequent checkpoints, and simplified mechanics have become prevalent, sacrificing the sense of challenge and accomplishment that defined old school gaming. 
                          This accessibility-oriented approach, while appealing to a broader audience, can lead to shorter and less fulfilling gameplay experiences for seasoned players seeking a greater sense of mastery.</p>

                        <br><p>Another concern with modern gaming is the increased reliance on microtransactions and downloadable content (DLC). While DLC can provide additional content and extend the lifespan of a game, it has also
                         become a vehicle for monetization. Players often find themselves confronted with paywalls or in-game purchases that hinder their progress or artificially enhance their abilities. This model can create an uneven playing field,
                          favoring those willing to spend additional money and detracting from the pure enjoyment and fair competition that characterized old school gaming.

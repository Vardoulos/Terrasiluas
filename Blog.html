                    <div class="article-text"><p>While modern gaming has undoubtedly brought exciting advancements, it's essential to reflect on the aspects that made old school gaming so beloved.
                         One downside of modern gaming is the shift towards a more streamlined and casual experience. In the past, games often required perseverance, patience, and skill to progress.
                          Nowadays, hand-holding tutorials, frequent checkpoints, and simplified mechanics have become prevalent, sacrificing the sense of challenge and accomplishment that defined old school gaming. 
                          This accessibility-oriented approach, while appealing to a broader audience, can lead to shorter and less fulfilling gameplay experiences for seasoned players seeking a greater sense of mastery.</p>

                        <br><p>Another concern with modern gaming is the increased reliance on microtransactions and downloadable content (DLC). While DLC can provide additional content and extend the lifespan of a game, it has also
                         become a vehicle for monetization. Players often find themselves confronted with paywalls or in-game purchases that hinder their progress or artificially enhance their abilities. This model can create an uneven playing field,
                          favoring those willing to spend additional money and detracting from the pure enjoyment and fair competition that characterized old school gaming.
